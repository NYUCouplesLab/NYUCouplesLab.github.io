										<h4>Professor Patrick Shrout leads the NYU Couples Lab. Pat received his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Chicago under the direction of Donald W. Fiske. He spent fifteen years on the biostatistics faculty at Columbia University doing work on screening for mental disorders, diagnostic reliability, and psychiatric epidemiology. After moving to NYU psychology he began to work on dyadic support and coping processes in longitudinal studies. His methodological interests and focus on psychological process allow him to support students with a variety of interests in social psychology.

Her project currently focuses on how construal level and shared reality differs between chosen and unchosen (arranged) romantic relationships. She hopes to become a pediatric psychiatrist in the near future. </h4>
